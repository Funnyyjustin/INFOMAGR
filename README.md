# INFOMAGR

This repository contains a project for the course INFOMAGR Advanced Graphics from Utrecht University.
The project contains a C++ template for a renderer with Ray Tracing. The template is based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

The folder `Template` contains the project, as well as a README on how to build the project and configure its settings.
