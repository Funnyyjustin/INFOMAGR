# INFOMAGR

This repository contains three projects; one template, and two assignments for the course INFOMAGR Advanced Graphics from Utrecht University.
1. **Template**: this folder contains a C++ template for a renderer with Ray Tracing. The template is based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
